# Test Suite

This project uses [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) for its automated tests. All test files live in this `tests` directory.

## Running the tests

From the repository root run:

```bash
phpunit -c tests/phpunit.xml
```

The command expects `phpunit` to be available in your `PATH`. If you do not have it installed, download the PHPUnit PHAR release and invoke it with `php phpunit.phar`.
